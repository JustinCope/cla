Hi all, the workstation committee has finalized our application decisions. We regret to inform you that, due to high demand, we don't have a workstation that you can use this semester.

Sorry! Preference was given to applicants who explained how they would get a great deal of use out of their workstation, especially if they are close to finishing their dissertation.

However, there may be available locker space on the eastside, and/or overhead bin space on the westside. If you would like to pursue this option, please reply to this email and we will see what's available.
